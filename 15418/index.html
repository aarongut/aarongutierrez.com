    <h2>Final Write Up</h2>

    <h3>Summary</h3>
    <p>ISPC++ adds support for numeric polymorphic functions to the Intel SPMD
    Program Compiler. Programmers can write a single function definition and use
    the same function on any appropriate numeric type.</p>

    <h3>Background</h3>
    <p>ISPC++ is a <a href="https://github.com/aarongut/ispc">fork</a> of the
    <a href="https://ispc.github.io/ispc.html"> Intel SPMD Program Compiler
      (ISPC)</a>. ISPC aims to make writing programs that take advantage
    of SIMD vector instructions easy for a C or C++ programmer. Because of the
    target application, most functions perform computations on numeric data.
    Based off of the C language, an ISPC program must include multiple
    different definitions for each appropriate datatype.</p>

    <p>ISPC++ removes that burden by providing polymorphic numeric types and
    automatically compiling multiple versions of functions for use with
    different datatypes. The programmer now needs to only write and maintain a
    single version of each function. </p>

    <code><pre>
<span class="type">number</span> <span class="ident">pow</span>(<span class="type">number</span> <span class="ident">b</span>, <span class="type">int</span> <span class="ident">a</span>) {
    <span class="type">number</span> <span class="ident">out</span> <span class="op">=</span> <span class="ident">b</span>;
    <span class="keyword">for</span> (<span class="type">int</span> <span class="ident">i</span> <span class="op">=</span> 1; <span class="ident">i</span><span class="op">&lt;</span><span class="ident">a</span>; <span class="ident">i</span><span class="op">++</span>) {
        <span class="ident">out</span> <span class="op">*=</span> <span class="ident">b</span>;
    }

    <span class="keyword">return</span> <span class="ident">out</span>;
}

<span class="keyword">export</span> <span class="type">void</span> <span
class="ident">square</span>(<span class="type">uniform int</span> <span
class="ident">N</span>, <span class="type">uniform number</span> <span
class="ident">b</span>[], <span class="type">uniform number</span> <span class="ident">out</span>[]) {
    <span class="keyword">foreach</span> (<span class="ident">i</span> <span class="op">=</span> 0 <span class="op">...</span> <span class="ident">N</span>) {
        <span class="ident">out</span>[<span class="ident">i</span>] <span class="op">=</span> <span class="ident">pow</span>(<span class="ident">b</span>[<span class="ident">i</span>], 2);
    }
}</pre>

    <h3>Approach</h3>
    <p>Modifications to ISPC fall into two broad categories: adding support for
    polymorphic type, and expanding functions with polymorphic arguments.<p>

    <p>To add support for polymorphic types, I created a new type class
    <kbd>PolyType</kbd>. There are three varieties: integer, floating, and
    number. As with the other basic types in ISPC, we can have uniform or
    varying, in addition to const, versions of each type. With the new types
    added, the parser was modified to produce the new types. Finally, the new
    cases produced by the new types are handled in typechecking.</p>

    <p>After typechecking a function, we check for polymorphic parameters. If a
    function has any polymorphic parameters, we create all of the permutations
    of the function prototype. These prototypes are stored to produce the proper
    header file later.</p>

    <p>When adding definitions to the declarations, we traverse the abstract
    syntax tree replacing the polymorphic types with the appropriate type from
    the function definition. After this step is done, we are left with
    overloaded functions and no polymorphic types. The rest of compilation
    occurs normally.</p>

    <p>When writing the final output, we add wrappers around all of the
    polymorphic functions to enable convenient use from our C++ program.</p>

    <p>For example, if we have a function <kbd>void foo(uniform int N, uniform
      floating A[])</kbd>, we'd have the following header file:</p>

    <code>
      <pre><span class="comment">/* boilerplate from ISPC */</span>
    <span class="keyword">extern</span> <span class="type">void</span> <span class="ident">foo_uni_un_3C_und_3E_</span>(<span class="type">int32_t</span> <span class="ident">N</span>, <span class="type">double</span> * <span class="ident">X</span>);
    <span class="keyword">extern</span> <span class="type">void</span> <span class="ident">foo_uni_un_3C_unf_3E_</span>(<span class="type">int32_t</span> <span class="ident">N</span>, <span class="type">float</span> * <span class="ident">X</span>);

#if defined(__cplusplus)
    <span class="keyword">extern</span> <span class="type">void</span> <span class="ident">foo</span>(<span class="type">int32_t</span> <span class="ident">N</span>, <span class="type">double</span> * <span class="ident">X</span>) {
        <span class="keyword">return</span> <span class="ident">foo_uni_un_3C_und_3E_</span>(<span class="ident">N</span>, <span class="ident">X</span>);
    }
    <span class="keyword">extern</span> <span class="type">void</span> <span class="ident">foo</span>(<span class="type">int32_t</span> <span class="ident">N</span>, <span class="type">float</span> * <span class="ident">X</span>) {
        <span class="keyword">return</span> <span class="ident">foo_uni_un_3C_unf_3E_</span>(<span class="ident">N</span>, <span class="ident">X</span>);
    }

<span class="comment">/* more boilerplate */</span>
</pre></code>

    <h3>Language Specification</h3>
    <p>Most of the language is unchanged from ISPC. The specification can be
    found in the ISPC <a
      href="https://ispc.github.io/ispc.html#the-ispc-language">documentation</a>.</p>

    <p>The only change is the 3 new types. The semantics follow if you treat the
    types as their representative atomic types.</p>
    <code>
<pre>&lt;type&gt;        := &lt;variability&gt; &lt;typename&gt&lt;quant&gt;;
               | <span class="comment">/* all the other ISPC types</span>
               ;
&lt;variability&gt; := <span class="ident">uniform</span>
               | <span class="ident">varying</span>
               | <span class="comment">/* empty, varying */</span>
               ;
&lt;typename&gt;    := <span class="ident">integer</span>
               | <span class="ident">floating</span>
               | <span class="ident">number</span>
               ;
&lt;quant&gt;       := <span class="ident">$</span>[0-9]+
               | <span class="comment">/* empty, default quantifier */</span>
               ;</pre>
    </code>
    <p class="caption">Specification for an ISPC++ type</p>

    <p><kbd>integer</kbd> is expanded to all of the integer types (signed and
    unsigned, 8, 16, 32, and 64 bits). <kbd>floating</kbd> is expanded to both
    <kbd>float</kbd> and <kbd>double</kbd>. <kbd>number</kbd> is expanded to the
    union of the set of types for <kbd>integer</kbd> and
    <kbd>floating</kbd>.</p>

    <p>The quantifier is used to distinguish independent polymorphic types. If
    no quantifier is specified, all similar types are considered identical.
    Otherwise, types with different quantifiers are expanded independently. The
    syntax for quantifiers has changed since the start of my project to avoid
    conflict with vector types.</p>

    <p>In the saxpy function bellow, we use type quantifiers to specify that the
    input types can vary independent of the output type.</p>

    <code>
      <pre><span class="keyword">export</span> <span class="type">void</span> <span class="ident">saxpy</span>(<span class="keyword">uniform</span> <span class="keyword">int</span> <span class="ident">N</span>,
                  <span class="keyword">uniform</span> <span class="type">floating$0</span> <span class="ident">scale</span>,
                  <span class="keyword">uniform</span> <span class="type">floating$1</span> <span class="ident">X</span>[],
                  <span class="keyword">uniform</span> <span class="type">floating$1</span> <span class="ident">Y</span>[],
                  <span class="keyword">uniform</span> <span class="type">floating$2</span> <span class="ident">result</span>[])
{
    <span class="keyword">foreach</span> (<span class="ident">i</span> <span class="op">=</span> 0 <span class="op">...</span> <span class="ident">N</span>) {
        <span class="type">floating$2</span> <span class="ident">tmp</span> <span class="op">=</span> <span class="ident">scale</span> <span class="op">*</span> <span class="ident">X</span>[<span class="ident">i</span>] <span class="op">+</span> <span class="ident">Y</span>[<span class="ident">i</span>];
        <span class="ident">result</span>[<span class="ident">i</span>] <span class="op">=</span> <span class="ident">tmp</span>;
    }
}</pre>
    </code>
    <p class="caption">Example <kbd>saxpy</kbd> program showing quantified
    polymorphic types</p>


    <p>A function may only return a polymorphic type if that type appears in the
    parameters. Any polymorphic type found in a function body not found in the
    parameters is cause for a typechecking error.</p>


    <h3>Results</h3>
    <p>At present, my compiler works as intended on all of my test cases.</p>

    <h4>Maintain full compatibility with the ISPC language</h4>
    <p>To my first goal of maintaining compatibility with ISPC, out of 1330 test
    cases, I fail 1 due to a variable named <kbd>number</kbd> which is now the
    name of a type, and then 3 others that involve an implicit struct
    definition, which I'll accept as minimally disruptive.</p>

    <h4>Produce C and C++ compatible object code</h4>
    <p>Compatibility with C++ is excellent: the produced header file defines a
    single overloaded function for each exported polymorphic function that can
    be used from the namespace <kbd>ispc</kbd>.</p>
    <p>Compatibility with C is worse, but functional. Each version of a
    polymorphic function is exported, but with a mangled name. Given that C does
    not support polymorphic functions, this is as best as we can hope to do, but
    working in C++ should be greatly preferred.</p>

    <h4>Produce performant, vectorized versions of polymorphic functions</h4>
    <p>Given that the backend of the compiler is not modified, the resulting
    object file should be identical to non-polymorphic code. I do not have
    extensive benchmarks, as I assumed performance would not be an issue, but
    from my testing performance is not a concern.</p>

    <p>Within ISPC, polymorphic functions are supported natively through
    function overloading, including with concurrency through the
    <kbd>launch</kbd> semantic.</p>

    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>Overall, I would consider ISPC++ a success. Aside from the issues with
    implicitly defined structs, my finished product matches my vision coming
    into this project and from my proposal.</p>

    <p>We are able to easily make some academic observations using the new
    functionality. For example, I modified our square root function from the
    first assignment to observe single vs. double precision performance.</p>
    <code><pre>[sqrt float serial]:            [779.727] ms
[sqrt double serial]:           [785.532] ms
[sqrt float ispc]:              [117.996] ms
[sqrt double ispc]:             [270.264] ms
[sqrt float task ispc]:         [27.195] ms
[sqrt double task ispc]:        [56.185] ms
                                (6.61x speedup from ISPC float)
                                (2.91x speedup from ISPC double)
                                (28.67x speedup from task ISPC float)
                                (13.98x speedup from task ISPC double)</pre>
    </code>
    <p class="caption">Newton's square root algorithm with single and double
    precision values on an Intel Xeon E5-1660 v4 @ 3.20GHz</p>

    <p>We can see that the speedup from vectorization is much lower with
    doubles, while the speedup from tasks is comparable regardless of type. I
    was able to run this test without duplicating any ISPC code. This conclusion
    isn't surprising, given that we operate on half as many values when we
    double the precision, but as a curious student, I can try any datatype or
    modify the function without duplicating definitions.</p>

    <p>In the same way ISPC enables a programmer to easily produce programs that
    take advantage of modern CPU's, ISPC++ furthers that mission by reducing
    code duplication. The easier it is for programmers to write high performance
    code, the more programmers will write high performance code.</p>

    <h3>Work Completed</h3>
    <p>I have a proof of concept implementation working. Using aggressive
    textual replacement, it produces valid ISPC, with a different function for
    each combination of polymorphic types.</p>

    <code>
      <pre><span class="keyword">export</span> <span class="type">void</span> <span class="ident">saxpy</span>(<span class="keyword">uniform</span> <span class="keyword">int</span> <span class="ident">N</span>,

        <span class="ident">result</span>[<span class="ident">i</span>] <span class="op">=</span> <span class="ident">tmp</span>;
    }
}</pre>
    </code>

    <p>This simple SAXPY program produces a header file with multiple overloaded
    definitions for the saxpy function. From the example, you can see the syntax
    used for polymorphic types: <samp>floating&lt;0&gt;</samp> represents an
    arbitrary floating point type, where the number is used to differentiate
    independent polymorphic types. The only polymorphic types allowed are
    <samp>floating</samp>, <samp>integer</samp>, and <samp>number</samp>. This
    restriction solves one of the more complicated issues with separate
    compilation of polymorphic code: we always generate all permutations of
    polymorphic functions. We end up with an exponential blow up in code size,
    but practical functions will likely only have a few polymorphic
    parameters.</p>

    <h3>Upcoming Work</h3>
    <p>The next big step will be to modify the ISPC parser and elaboration
    phases. My goals are largely unchanged, and I feel on track to produce a
    complete, working solution:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Maintain full compatibility with the ISPC language</li>
      <li>Produce C and C++ compatible object code</li>
      <li>Produce performant, vectorized versions of polymorphic functions</li>
      <li>Integrate support for polymorphic functions into ISPC</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Updated Schedule</h3>
    <p>Due to illness and a realization that a preprocessor based implementation
    would result in redundant work, I am no longer aiming to produce a complete
    preprocessor based solution.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>April 15: implement a proof of concept, regex based preprocessor and
        any needed runtime</li>
      <li>April 19: modify the ISPC backend to generate the correct header files
        for both C++ and C use.</li>
      <li><del>April 25: complete a preprocessor based implementation</del></li>
      <li>April 29: mostly-complete code generation implementation integrated
        into ISPC</li>
      <li>May 3: typechecking and parsing completed</li>
      <li>May 6: final implementation completed</li>
      <li>May 12: all documentation and analysis completed</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Proposal</h2>

    <p>ISPC++ is a <a href="https://github.com/aarongut/ispc">fork</a> of the <a
      href="https://ispc.github.io/ispc.html"> Intel SPMD Program Compiler
      (ISPC)</a> project that includes support of polymorphic datatypes and
    functions.</p>

    <h3>Background</h3>
    <p>ISPC aims to make writing single program multiple data (SPMD) programs
    easy and relatively target-agnostic. The programmer does not need to write
    vector intrinsics for each target platform, but can still closely reason
    about a programs' mapping to hardware. The language closely resembles C, and
    produces object files compatible with conventional C or C++ programs.</p>

    <p>With roots in C, ISPC faces the same limitation to code reuse as C; in
    particular, both languages lack polymorphism.  Given that ISPC functions are
    primarily arithmetic in nature, adding polymorphism will enable programmers
    to write a single procedure and use it with any vector-supported datatype. A
    single function definition can be used with different sized datatypes or
    even both floating point and integer versions.</p>

    <p>Similarly to how ISPC frees the programmer from re-writing functions
    using different versions of intrinsics, ISPC++ will extend the abstraction to
    include different operands.</p>

    <h3>Problem</h3>
    <p>The root of the challenge stems from maintaining compatibility with ISPC
    and with C or C++. ISPC is a large application with support for a wide range
    of targets, and a successful project will not inhibit that flexibility.</p>

    <h3>Resources</h3>
    <p>This is a direct fork of the ISPC project. Hopefully, ISPC++ will share
    the same compatibility as ISPC, able to run across platforms and with any
    number of vector targets.</p>

    <h3>Goals</h3>
    <p>This project aims to</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Maintain full compatibility with the ISPC language</li>
      <li>Produce C and C++ compatible object code</li>
      <li>Produce performant, vectorized versions of polymorphic functions</li>
    </ul>
    <p>and hopefully fully supports</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Add support for polymorphic functions somewhat similar to C++ via a
        preprocessor pass</li>
      <li>Integrate support for polymorphic functions into ISPC</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Assessment</h3>
    <p>The first three goals are pretty hard requirements. For the last two
    there is some ability to have partial success. This project will be
    completely successful if a programmer can write a single ISPC++ function and
    use that function with any appropriate datatypes via overloading in C++. Any
    restrictions placed on expressiveness should be avoided. For example, if the
    solution makes use of regular expressions rather than integrating with the
    AST, I would consider the project only a partial success.</p>

    <h3>Schedule</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>April 15: implement a proof of concept, regex based preprocessor and
        any needed runtime</li>
      <li>April 19: modify the ISPC backend to generate the correct header files
        for both C++ and C use.</li>
      <li>April 25: complete a preprocessor based implementation</li>
      <li>April 29: incomplete implementation integrated into ISPC</li>
      <li>May 6: final implementation completed</li>
      <li>May 12: all documentation and analysis completed</li>
    </ul>
