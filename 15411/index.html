    <h1>C0 to Clac: Targeting a Stack-based Virtual Machine</h1>
    <p>Aaron Gutierrez &amp; Shyam Raghavan</p>
    <p>15-411 Final Project</p>
    <p>Fall 2015</p>

  <hr>
<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>As current 15-122 TAs, we felt as though an interesting and difficult project
would be to retarget the L4 compiler to a minimal adaptation of Clac. Through
the implementation of this retargeted compiler, we hoped to learn the following:
how to retarget a register-based language to a stack-based virtual machine
language; how to minimize the instruction set needed for a normally very large
register-based instruction set to a very small stack-based instruction set; and
how to develop conventions for a very small language that mimic behaviors of a
very large language.</p>

<p>In order to learn more about Clac and the process of compiling to a
stack-based language, we researched information about Forth and the development
philosophy behind Forth. This helped us determine what modifications were
available to make Clac more targetable.</p>

<p>We also researched methods for considering the optimizations of stack-based
virtual machines and for register allocation on the stack. While we decided that
we would not focus on optimizations and would instead ensure correctness, we did
implement a simple register allocator to better utilize the operand stack.</p>

<p>Retargeting the register-based x86-64 assembly language into a stack-based
virtual machine language allowed us to delve into the specifics of the
implementation of compilers that target stack-based virtual machines (like the
Java Virtual Machine). One of the traditional advantages of a stack-based
virtual machine language is that the instruction set (and therefore the number
of bytes needed to represent each instruction) is very small - a disadvantage
(that we clearly rediscovered) is that because the instructions are less
specific, more instructions (and the total number of bytes needed to represent
them) are needed to achieve the same functionality. Finally, we also needed to
develop conventions on function calling, function flow, and memory - because we
were retargeting from x86-64 assembly, most of the conventions we developed were
inspired by it.</p>

<p>The development of this retargeted compiler, while not immediately useful,
helped us learn skills necessary for engineering software for a rapidly-moving,
ever-changing target, required us to be very careful in the engineering and the
maintenance of conventions for a language and virtual machine, and forced us to
consider tradeoffs between performance and correctness with the short amount of
time and resources we had to complete the compiler.</p>

<h1 id="project">Project</h1>
<p>For this project, we chose to retarget C0 code to a minimal adaptation of the
interpreted language based off of Clac used in 15-122 Principles of Imperative
Computation called Clac.</p>

<p>In order to accomplish this, we must minimally alter the Clac runtime to
allow for heap-like memory access and allocation. We must also alter the
compiler to produce a stack-based internal representation and a back-end
Clac-based representation. In sum, this means augmenting the internal
representation and the back-end of the compiler.</p>

<p>We aimed to keep the clac language as close to the original as possible. The
majority of the work in this project is derived from the difficulty in adapting
an internal representation designed to target x86-64 assembly to output clac.
While we could have improved performance and optimizations, we chose to instead
focus on correctness and developed with the explicit belief that correctness was
paramount over performance given our time constraints and the resources
available.</p>

<h1 id="implementation">Implementation</h1>
<h2 id="modifications-to-the-claculator">Modifications to the Claculator</h2>
<p>The Clac language needed to be extended in order to successfully compile all
(or at least a significant portion) of the features needed by the L4 language.
We started with a working implementation of the Claculator from the <a
href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~fp/courses/15122-f15/assignments/clac-writeup.pdf">fall
2015 version of the 15-122 assignment</a>, which has user-defined tokens. We
were able to implement almost all of the control flow needed using just
user-defined tokens, with one exception, noted below.</p>

<p>Our first modification adds a mutable, global array of values to complement
the operand stack. To use the memory array, the following instructions were
added:</p>

<dl>
<dt>get:</dt>
<dd><span><code>n get</code></span> will take the value stored at index <span
  class="math inline"><em>n</em></span> and place it at the top of the operand
stack </dd>

<dt>put:</dt>
<dd><span><code>v n put</code></span> will place the value <span class="math
  inline"><em>v</em></span> at index <span class="math inline"><em>n</em></span>
in the memory array </dd>

<dt>alloc:</dt>
<dd><span><code>n alloc</code></span> allocates a contiguous block of memory for
<span class="math inline"><em>n</em></span> values and places the index of the
first location on the top of the operand stack</dd>
</dl>

<p>These instructions were designed to be in the spirit of the original Clac
language. The <span><code>get</code></span> and <span><code>put</code></span>
tokens are similar in behavior to the <span><code>!</code></span> and
<span><code>@</code></span> words, respectively, in the Forth language upon
which Clac is based. The <span><code>alloc</code></span> token serves an
analogous purpose to the same keyword in L4.</p>

<p>Additionally, the remaining comparison operators,
<span><code>&lt;=, &gt;=, =, !=</code></span> were added. These behave as
expected. Bitwise operators were added to support bitwise arithmetic. Bitwise
and (<span><code>&amp;</code></span>), or (<span><code>|</code></span>), and
exclusive or (<span><code>^</code></span>), along with arithmetic shifts
(<span><code>&lt;&lt;</code></span> and <span><code>&gt;&gt;</code></span>),
behave as they do in C0 and L4.</p>

<p>A couple other modifications were made to support programs that do not return
a value. The <span><code>abort</code></span> token causes the Claculator to
raise a <span><code> SIGABRT</code></span> signal, used for assertions.
<span><code>c0_mem_error</code></span> raises a
<span><code>SIGUSR2</code></span> signal, used to indicate memory errors in the
source program, rather than the Claculator.</p>

<p>With the above extensions, we are able to compile almost all programs in the
L4 language, with one large exception. Clac’s only control flow tokens are
<span><code>if</code></span> and <span><code>skip</code></span>. In order to
handle programs that contain loops, the loop guard and loop body become separate
functions. As a result, without further modification, we could not compile
programs that return inside the body of a loop.</p>

<p>One of the features of the calculator that we aimed to preserve is the
simplicity of the interpreter loop. Though the introduction of user-defined
tokens and the call stack complicates things slightly, for the most part it
consists of a queue where each token is considered exactly once. If we were to
add backwards skips, the interpreter would become significantly more involved.
So in order to support returning from the body of a loop, we made hack that aims
to leave the interpreter loop simple.</p>

<p>To overcome that shortcoming we introduced a special
<span><code>return</code></span> token. For most functions,
<span><code>return</code></span> causes the rest of the instruction queue to be
skipped, and the stack is left unmodified. But for functions whose names start
with ‘.’ <span><code>return</code></span> causes the current function
<em>and</em> the calling function to return. If the calling function’s name also
starts with ‘.’, it’s calling function also returns recursively. We are
therefore allowed to use functions like basic blocks and keep the interpreter
loop relatively simple.</p>

<p>In order to better match the behavior of a C0 program, the Claculator was
modified to not print a prompt or the operand stack when reading from a file,
and to return the top value on the stack, if it exists, when exiting.</p>

<h2 id="modifications-to-our-compiler">Modifications to Our Compiler</h2>
<p>Because Clac programs are quite significantly different than x86-64 programs,
we had to add a completely new back end to our compiler. We are able to use the
same intermediate tree representation for both the x86-64 and the Clac back end.
From that point, we add two new steps to generate Clac code.</p>

<p>Our first translation targets a high-level stack-based form that contains
variables, branches, and unconditional jumps. This serves mostly as a
translation from infix to reverse polish form. An example program in this form
can be seen in Figure 1.</p>

<p>From this high-level language, then translate to Clac. Because Clac doesn’t
specify how the memory array should be used, we emulate the x86_64 stack
discipline. All function arguments are passed on the stack, and temporary
variables are assigned from the highest-index down. Our Clac implementation
creates a 50,000 element memory array, so we start from index 49,999. To
simulate stack frames, we use memory address 0 as a pseudo-stack pointer. For
example, the <span class="math
inline"><em>n</em><sup><em>t</em><em>h</em></sup></span> local variable for a
function is access by:</p>

<p><span><code>0 get n + get</code></span></p>

<p>The value at address 0 is decremented the appropriate amount at the start of
each function, and increment before every instance of
<span><code>return</code></span>.</p>

<p>Conditional branches like</p>

<p><span><code>… exp if stms else stms …</code></span></p>

<p>are expanded to</p>

<p><span><code>… exp if .1 1 skip .2 …;
: .1 stms ;
: .2 stms ;</code></span></p>

<p>Loops such as</p>

<p><span><code>… .1 exp if stms goto .1 else …</code></span></p>

<p>become</p>

<p><span><code>… .1 …;
: .1 exp if .2 1 skip .3 ;
: .2 stms .1 ;
: .3 ;</code></span></p>

<p>Translation of arithmetic and stack manipulation expressions are mostly
trivial. The final output of our sample program can be seen in Figure 2.</p>

<figure>
<pre class="figure-code"><code>: _c0_foo 0 get 3 - 0 put 0 get 0 + put 2 0 get 0 + get * 0 get 1 + put 0 get 0 + get 0 &lt; 1 = if .6 1 skip .7 0 get 1 + get 0 get 3 + 0 put return ;
: .6 0 0 get 1 + put ;
: .7 ;
: _c0_main 0 get 0 - 0 put 5 _c0_foo 0 get 0 + 0 put return ;

49999 0 put _c0_main</code></pre>
<figcaption>Figure 2: Example program compiled to Clac</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>At the end of our Clac source file, we see our minimal runtime, which sets
the stack pointer to the largest index, and calls the function
<span><code>_c0_main</code></span>.</p>

<p>Memory operations were very straight forward to implement. Unlike when
implementing L4 for x86-64, pointers are the same size as integers, because
pointers are just indexes into the memory array. Dereferencing a pointer <span
class="math inline"><em>p</em></span> is simply
<span><code>p get get</code></span>, and computing array and struct offsets are
greatly simplified by the fact that all small types have size 1.</p>

<p>In order to support array bound checking, the size of the array needs to be
stored in memory. We employ the same strategy as before, storing the size at the
index before the first array element. Bounds checks and null checks are
implemented exactly as before, adding an if statement before all accesses and
conditionally evaluating the new <span><code>c0_mem_error</code></span> token in
Clac if the access is invalid. <span><code>NULL</code></span> is represented by
the value 0.</p>

<h2 id="register-allocation">Register Allocation</h2>
<p>In the most straightforward translation, the operand stack is rarely
employed. To increase utilization of the stack, we implemented Koopman’s
algorithm for register allocation on stack machines. The algorithm as
implemented is described below.</p>

<section class="algorithm">
<h3>Koopman’s Algorithm, as implemented</h3>
<ol>
<li><p>Compute the set of temps that is used at some point after each line
  within basic blocks. This analysis is greatly simplified as the only Clac
  instruction that uses a value is <span><code>get</code></span>.</p></li>

<li><p>For each temp that is used within a block, when it is first written to,
  additionally push a copy of the value onto the top of the operand
  stack.</p></li>

<li><p>For subsequent reads, replace the <span><code>get</code></span>
  instruction with a <span><code>pick</code></span> instruction that moves the
  corresponding value to the top of the stack</p></li>
</ol>
</section>

<p>For simple programs, our register allocator works correctly. However, our
implementation is not correct for all inputs, and time did not permit more
effort to correct our implementation. As such, register allocation is disabled
by default, but can be enabled with the <span><code>–clac-alloc</code></span>
flag.</p>

<p>Because of the nature of the stack, values are not always in the same
location relative to the top. As such, care must be taken to keep track of where
values are located.</p>

</figure>

<p>In Figure 3, we see a sample program with and without register allocation.
Notice that we still place values in the memory array even though they are no
longer used. An implementation that recognizes dead
<span><code>put</code></span> instructions is outside the scope of our project,
but would be interesting to study further.</p>

<h1 id="testing-methodology">Testing Methodology</h1>
<p>To test our implementation, we reused most of the tests from Lab 5. Any test
that used library functions were deleted, as we did not port the full runtime to
Clac, but all other features of L4 were implemented.</p>

<p>To run tests against our implementation, we modified the existing testing
framework to pass the necessary flag for our compiler to target Clac. To run the
code and produce output, it then calls our modified Claculator with the compiled
Clac code. The Claculator is linked with a library that raises the correct
signals to test for memory errors, <span><code>SIGABRT</code></span> is
generated using the C0 <span><code>assert</code></span> function, and otherwise
the value returned from the main method is return by the main method of the
Claculator. Thus, we should see exactly the same effects from running our Clac
code using the Claculator and the same code compiled natively for x86-64. As
such, the testing framework took very little modification.</p>

<p>For speed, the Claculator is compiled with the unsafe C0 runtime using the
<span><code>-O2</code></span> flag for gcc. Even so, execution time is
significantly higher than running the native executable. For instance, the gcd
benchmark runs around 500 times slower than our native compiler output with all
optimizations disabled. We could have chosen to increase the timeouts for
testing, but chose not to so that the grading time was still sane.</p>

<h1 id="analysis">Analysis</h1>

<h2 id="quantitative-analysis">Quantitative Analysis</h2>
<p>We explicitly made the decision to not focus on optimizations or performance
- this decision was made with the reasoning that (a) the virtual machine
implementation of Clac has no way of being possibly as fast as the hardware
instruction set given by x86-64 assembly, precisely because the virtual machine
implementation of Clac is compiled into x86-64 assembly, (b) stack-based
machines are empirically slower than register-based machines because of the
larger number of instructions, and (c) with the limited amount of time and
resources we had available, we felt as though we needed to focus on either
correctness or performance, and chose correctness to be paramount.</p>

<p>While we did make this decision, it is important to note that, as mentioned
earlier, the <span><code>gcd</code></span> benchmark runs about 500 times slower
on the Clac virtual machine than on the native compiler output with all
optimizations disabled. In addition, running on a system with two quad-core
Intel X5560 CPUs running at 2.8Ghz and the default timeouts in the autograder,
208 tests timed out, as opposed to the regression tests, in which 72 tests timed
out.</p>

<p>Again, because this was not the focus of this project, we chose to disregard
performance issues and focus on improving correctness throughout our time
working on the compiler. In the future, to improve the performance of our
Clac-targeted compiler, we could improve the stack-frame addressing system -
rather than executing 5 instructions (<span><code>0 get i + get</code></span>)
to get the <span class="math inline"><em>i</em></span>th stack-frame variable,
we could either alter the instruction set to include a stack pointer or improve
the ability of the compiler to decide what needs to be stored on the operand
stack and/or on the stack frame. We could also reduce the amount of dead code
created by the compiler - while function arguments are evaluated from left to
right in C0, the way we were able to implement this was by evaluating them from
left to right, dropping them off the operand stack, and then evaluating them
from right to left in preparation of calling the function (because the calling
convention developed expected the arguments in left-to-right order). In order to
reduce this dead code, we could either alter the calling convention to expect
the arguments in right-to-left order (and then, instead of dropping arguments
upon left-to-right evaluation, we leave it on the operand stack) or alter the
specification that arguments are evaluated in left-to-right order.</p>

<p>Regardless of the improvements we can make to the Clac runtime or the
compiled code, we know that we will never be able to improve the performance of
the Clac virtual machine to be faster than that of x86-64 assembly. Because the
only test cases we fail are those that particularly stress the compiler or the
runtime, we feel as though the performance is robust enough for demonstration to
curious 15-122 students that wonder why they’re asked to add function
definitions to a language like Clac.</p>

<p>On that point, with the single addition of the memory array, a large number
of C0 programs can be successfully compiled to clac. Provided that all functions
only return at the end, the addition of <span><code>return</code></span> to clac
is avoided. With under 20 simple lines of additional code, a 15-122 student
could have a way to run non-trivial programs in their own clac implementation
for testing and exploration purposes.</p>

<h2 id="qualitative-analysis">Qualitative Analysis</h2>
<p>In terms of qualitative analysis, it appears that Clac code is in fact
(although precedent tells us that this is not the case) more concise than x86-64
assembly. This is probably because of the discrepancy between Clac being a
virtual machine language and x86-64 assembly being a hardware instruction
set.</p>

<p>The hardest areas to implement involved the design and fleshing out of the
conventions having to do with control flow and calling functions. The
difficulties presented themselves because there were no existing conventions,
and many possibilities either allowed for ambiguities or did not ascribe to C0
conventions. For example, while some solutions for things like
<span><code>if-else</code></span> control flow did ascribe to C0 semantics, they
left room for ambiguities in the manner in which code that returned from a
branch was supposed to execute. This particular problem was resolved with the
introduction of a <span><code>return</code></span> token, but decisions like
these forced us to carefully develop a set of guidelines and rules to follow
when designing and writing the compiler. While making these convention decisions
were not easy, the decisions that were made allowed the runtime for Clac to be
(a) minimally altered and (b) very easy to invoke.</p>

<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>In conclusion, while the retargeting of a C0 compiler to Clac virtual machine
code is not the most practically useful, we’ve learned quite a few skills that
will have very practical applications both in academia and in the software
industry.</p>

<p>By completing this compiler, we were able to develop our own calling
convention and control flow convention. We also developed a code generation step
from an intermediate tree representation to a stack-based intermediate
representation. All of these tasks required us to be very deliberate about
documentation, to consider tradeoffs between performance and correctness with a
limited amount of resources, and develop a piece of software for a
rapidly-changing target (like from x86-64 assembly to Clac virtual machine
code).</p>

<p>Finally, it has been an amazing experience and a really fun one building the
largest single piece of code we’ve seen from start to finish. We’ve enjoyed the
class immensely, and we’d like to thank Rob and the course staff for making it
such an enjoyable experience.</p>
